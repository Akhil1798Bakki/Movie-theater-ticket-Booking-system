# Movie-theater-ticket-Booking-system
This is a code written in Python for booking movie tickets where in this code we have implemented Graphical user interface for easy user interaction and the data handled by the user is stored in sqlit3 database in python.

In this project we have imported tkinter library for building a new window for booking tickets.
The database is created in this using sqlite3 library. And in this we have created two different tables one for creating account and the other table for booking tickets where the data in the table is stored in the Movie Database.

This is a project which helps user to book tickets with cancelation availability and check the history of users in booking the tickets in later dates too.
This project is user freindly in booking movie tickets easily and safely.
